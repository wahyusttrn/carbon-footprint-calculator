## Hello World!
This is my carbon footprint calculator with an OpenAI's Chatbot integration for my School's physics assignment.
The project was built using Create React App with simple Vanilla CSS.
I know CRA was already deprecated, but i built this 2 years ago for my first grade on High School anyway, so, yeah :).
You can fork or contribute to what i did here if you are interested.

If you want to modify this by yourself, you could simply clone this project to your local directory.
Here is the step:
- open up terminal/command prompt
- type `git clone https://github.com/wahyusttrn/carbon-footprint-calculator.git`
- get insde the directory that just automatically created 
- run `npm i`. it will import all the library i've used inside this project
- to start the project, run `npm start` and go to the localhost as shown on terminal/command prompt

And VOILA! You can now make the project better!
To see how i did after i host it, you can check [cfc-wahyusattriana.vercel.app/](https://cfc-wahyusattriana.vercel.app/)
